# bmi_calc

This app calculates your fitness by using a Bmi calculator.
Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height and is expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in meters.
