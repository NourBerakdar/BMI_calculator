# bmi_calc

This app calculates your fitness by using a Bmi calculator.
Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height and is expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in meters.
If you don't know about BMI Calculator you can read this site "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index".

# In This app:
* I used Flutter themes to create coherent branding.
* I created multi-page apps using Flutter Routes and Navigator.
* I passed functions as parameters and fields.
* I used the GestureDetector Widget to detect more than just a tap.
* I used custom color palettes by using hex codes.
* I customized Flutter Widgets to achieve a specific design style.
